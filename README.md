If `latest` is set for `loki_version`, the role tries to install the latest release version.  
**Please use this with caution, as incompatibilities between releases may occur!**

The binaries are installed below `/usr/local/bin/loki/${loki_version}` and later linked to `/usr/bin`. 
This should make it possible to downgrade relatively safely.

The Loki archive is stored on the Ansible controller, unpacked and then the binaries are copied to the target system.
The cache directory can be defined via the environment variable `CUSTOM_LOCAL_TMP_DIRECTORY`. 
By default it is `${HOME}/.cache/ansible/loki`.
If this type of installation is not desired, the download can take place directly on the target system. 
However, this must be explicitly activated by setting `loki_direct_download` to `true`.

### `loki_targets`

A list of components to run.  
The default value `all` runs Loki in single binary mode.  
The value `read` is an alias to run only read-path related components such as the `querier` and `query-frontend`, but all in the same process.
The value `write` is an alias to run only write-path related components such as the `distributor` and `compactor`, but all in the same process.

Supported values: 
  `all`, `compactor`, `distributor`, `ingester`, `querier`, `query-scheduler`,
 `ingester-querier`, `query-frontend`, `index-gateway`, `ruler`, `table-manager`, `read`, `write`.

### `loki_auth_enabled`

#### defaults

```yaml
loki_auth_enabled: false
```

### `loki_config_service`

Values to configure the service directly.  
Only values that are not listed in the configuration file are defined here.

```yaml
loki_config_service:
  validation:
    create_grace_period: ""
    enforce_metric_name: ""
    increment_duplicate_timestamps: ""
    max_entries_limit: ""
    max_label_names_per_series: ""
    max_length_label_name: ""
    reject_old_samples: ""
    reject_old_samples_max_age: ""
